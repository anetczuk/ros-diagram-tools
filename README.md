# ROS diagram tools

Generate various aspects of *Robot Operating System* workspace in form of diagrams and graphs.
To produce results package uses *Grpahviz* and *PlanutUML* diagram tools.

Package can produce following diagrams:
- source code distribution chart
- source packages dependency tree
- *ROS* nodes and topics graphs
- *rosbag* sequence graph

In addition there is `rosverifier` tool detecting packages overlay in *catkin* workspace.


## How to use?

1. run *dump* scripts to collect data
2. run diagram tool: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py {tool} {args}`

Depending on desired tool, user can run subset of *dump* scripts. 

Examples of provided diagrams can be seen in `/examples/` repo directory.
First example (`sample`) contains synthetic data. Example `turtlesim` presents 
structure of *turtlesim* tool.



## Requirements

Required dependency packages are needed to be installed before first run of main application. To do it execute one of commands:
- `src/install-deps.sh`
- `pip3 install -r ./src/requirements.txt`

Moreover scripts use command `catkin`. The command is provided by package `python3-catkin-tools` and can be installed by 
`sudo apt install python3-catkin-tools`.


## Tools

List of implemented tools:


### `rosdiagramtools.py codedistribution` - code distribution diagram

Tool presents distribution of code in source subdirectories.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py codedistribution --help`

[![code distribution chart](examples/simple/codedistribution/out/graph-small.png "code distribution chart")](examples/simple/codedistribution/out/graph.png)


### `rosdiagramtools.py catkintree` - catkin packages tree

Show workspace packages in form of dependency tree.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py catkintree --help`

[![catkin packages tree](examples/simple/catkinlist/out/graph-small.png "catkin packages tree")](examples/simple/catkinlist/out/graph.png)


### `rosdiagramtools.py classifynodes` - match nodes to packages

Tool tries to match ROS nodes (given by `rosnode` command) to source packages where nodes are implemented.


### `rosdiagramtools.py catkinschedule` - catkin build schedule

Presents schedule graph of workspace build consisting of build time of packages.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py catkinschedule --help`

[![turtlesim build times](turtlesim_catkinschedule-small.png "turtlesim build times")](doc/turtlesim_catkinschedule.png)

To generate graph execute following steps:
1. build workspace with command `catkin build > build_log.txt`
2. execute tool: 
```
rosdiagramtools.py catkinschedule -la \
                                  -f build_log.txt \
                                  -st 1 -sp 150 \
                                  --outhtml --outdir output_dir
```

Then graph will be available through file: `output_dir/full_graph.html`.

### `rosdiagramtools.py rosnodetree` - rosnode tree

Presents dependecy of *ROS* nodes, topics and services in form of data flow graph.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py rosnodetree --help`

[![ROS nodes, topics and services graph](examples/simple/rosnodelist/out/full_graph-small.png "ROS nodes, topics and services graph")](examples/simple/rosnodelist/out/full_graph.png)

In addition, for given graph interactive web page can be generated, [example here](examples/simple/rosnodelist/out/full_graph.html).

Following animation shows navigation thorough nodes of graph:

## `rosdiagramtools.py rostopictree` - rostopic tree

Present dependecy of *ROS* nodes and topics in form of dependency graph.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py rostopictree --help`

[![ROS nodes and topics graph](examples/simple/rostopiclist/out/graph-small.png "ROS nodes and topics graph")](examples/simple/rostopiclist/out/graph.png)


## `rosdiagramtools.py rosbagflow` - rosbag graph

Presents visualisation of *ROS* bag in form of sequence graph.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py rosbagflow --help`

[![ROS bag sequence graph](doc/turtlesim_rosbag-small.png "ROS bag sequence graph")](doc/turtlesim_rosbag.png)

Tool generates sequence diagram and interactive web page with following functionalities:
- viewing full graph,
- viewing messages of node and topic,
- viewing message data and message type definition,
- annotating messages with additional information (for example validation messages)

The web page output is stored [here](examples/turtlesim/rosbag/out/full_graph.html).


## `rosdiagramtools.py rosverify` - ROS verifier

Script detects packages overlay in given workspace and extended workspaces.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py rosverify --help`

Example output on `turtlesim` generated by command `rosdiagramtools.py rosverify`:
```
INFO:rosdiagram.tool.rosverify:found workspaces: ['/path/to/catkin_ws', '/opt/ros/noetic']
INFO:rosdiagram.tool.rosverify:all overlay packages: []
INFO:rosdiagram.tool.rosverify:workspace overlay packages: []
```



## Dumping information

Dumping required data is split into two scripts:
- `./src/dump_cloc.py` using `cloc` to dump source code info
- `./src/dump_ros.sh` using *ROS* tools and running `rosmaster` to collect data
