# ROS diagram tools

Generate various aspects of *Robot Operating System* workspace in form of diagrams, graphs and interactive views.
To produce results package uses *Grpahviz* and *PlanutUML* diagram tools.

Package can produce following diagrams:
- source code distribution chart
- source packages dependency tree
- `catkin` packages build schedule
- *ROS* nodes and topics graphs
- *rosbag* sequence graph

In addition there is `rosverifier` tool detecting packages overlay in *catkin* workspace.

Main motivation for the project was to present variuos aspects of *ROS* workspace in easy to understand form.



## How to use?

1. run *dump* scripts to collect data
2. run one of diagram tools: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py {tool} {args}`

Depending on desired tool, user can run subset of *dump* scripts. 

Examples of provided diagrams can be seen in `/examples/` repo directory.
First example (`sample`) contains synthetic data. Example `turtlesim` presents 
structure of *turtlesim* tool.

Whole commands list with description can be found [here](doc/cmd_args.md) by calling `rosdiagramtools.py --help`.



## Requirements

Required dependency packages are needed to be installed before first run of main application. To do it execute one of commands:
- `src/install-deps.sh`
- `pip3 install -r ./src/requirements.txt`

Moreover there are additional required packages: `python3-catkin-tools` (for `catkin`), `python3-rosdep`, `cloc`, 
`imagemagick`, `plantuml`. Installation: 
`sudo apt install python3-catkin-tools python3-rosdep cloc imagemagick plantuml`.



## Examples

In `/examples` there are few examples of generated diagrams:
- artificial [sample](examples/simple)
- [turtlesim](examples/turtlesim): build schedule, ros connections, rosbag sequence
- [turtlebot3](examples/turtlebot3): code distribution, packages tree, build schedule, ros verify
- [mecanum_simulator](examples/mecanum_simulator): code distribution, packages tree, build schedule, nodes classification, ros verify, ros connections



## Tools

Tools are divided into following categories:
- working on source code: `codedistribution`,
- working on catkin workspace: `catkintree`, `catkinschedule`, `rosverify`, `classifynodes`,
- working on running system: `rosnodetree`, `rostopictree`, `rosbagflow`.

From other perspective tools can be split into:
- ones working only with dumped data: `codedistribution`, `catkintree`, `catkinschedule`, `classifynodes`, `rosnodetree`, `rostopictree`, `rosbagflow`,
- ones requiring direct access: `rosverify`


List of tools:


### `rosdiagramtools.py codedistribution`

Tool presents distribution of code in source subdirectories.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py codedistribution --help`

[![code distribution chart](examples/simple/codedistribution/out/graph-small.png "code distribution chart")](examples/simple/codedistribution/out/graph.png)


### `rosdiagramtools.py catkintree`

Show workspace packages in form of dependency tree.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py catkintree --help`

[![catkin packages tree](examples/simple/catkinlist/out/graph-small.png "catkin packages tree")](examples/simple/catkinlist/out/graph.png)


### `rosdiagramtools.py classifynodes`

Tool tries to match ROS nodes (given by `rosnode` command) to source packages where nodes are implemented. Result is presented in form 
of text file.

Output example: [mecanum_simulator](examples/mecanum_simulator)


### `rosdiagramtools.py catkinschedule`

Presents schedule graph of workspace build consisting of build time of packages.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py catkinschedule --help`

[![turtlesim build times](doc/turtlesim_catkinschedule-small.png "turtlesim build times")](doc/turtlesim_catkinschedule.png)

To generate graph execute following steps:
1. build workspace with command `catkin build > build_log.txt`
2. execute tool: 
```
rosdiagramtools.py catkinschedule -la \
                                  -f build_log.txt \
                                  -st 1 -sp 150 \
                                  --outhtml --outdir output_dir
```

Then graph will be available through file: `output_dir/full_graph.html`.

More real-life example with full view is presented on folowing image:

### `rosdiagramtools.py rosverify`

Script detects packages overlay in given workspace and extended workspaces.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py rosverify --help`

Example output on `turtlesim` generated by command `rosdiagramtools.py rosverify`:
```
INFO:rosdiagram.tool.rosverify:found workspaces: ['/path/to/catkin_ws', '/opt/ros/noetic']
INFO:rosdiagram.tool.rosverify:all overlay packages: []
INFO:rosdiagram.tool.rosverify:workspace overlay packages: []
```


### `rosdiagramtools.py rosnodetree`

Presents dependecy of *ROS* nodes, topics and services in form of data flow graph.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py rosnodetree --help`

[![ROS nodes, topics and services graph](examples/simple/rosnodelist/out/full_graph-small.png "ROS nodes, topics and services graph")](examples/simple/rosnodelist/out/full_graph.png)

In addition, for given graph interactive web page can be generated, [example here](examples/simple/rosnodelist/out/full_graph.html).

Following animation shows navigation thorough nodes of graph:

Examlpe of service graph view:

### `rosdiagramtools.py rostopictree`

Present dependecy of *ROS* nodes and topics in form of dependency graph.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py rostopictree --help`

[![ROS nodes and topics graph](examples/simple/rostopiclist/out/graph-small.png "ROS nodes and topics graph")](examples/simple/rostopiclist/out/graph.png)


### `rosdiagramtools.py rosbagflow`

Presents visualisation of *ROS* bag in form of sequence graph.

Execution: `./src/rosdiagramtools.py rosbagflow --help`

[![ROS bag sequence graph](doc/turtlesim_rosbag-small.png "ROS bag sequence graph")](doc/turtlesim_rosbag.png)

Tool generates sequence diagram and interactive web page with following functionalities:
- viewing full graph,
- viewing messages of node and topic,
- viewing message data and message type definition,
- annotating messages with additional information (for example validation messages)

The web page output is stored [here](examples/turtlesim/rosbag/out/full_graph.html).

Example of node and message view preview can be found here: [turtlesim](examples/turtlesim) 


## Dumping information

Dumping required data is split into several scripts:
- `./src/dump_cloc.py` - stores source code info using `cloc` 
- `./src/dump_ros.sh` - stores *ROS* data using *ROS* tools (requires `rosmaster` to be run)
- `./src/dump_roslaunch.sh` - extracts nodes list spawned by given launch file
